## Work procces of each task:

### Task 1:

-   Clone the repository and follow the directions in the repository
-   Set up the backend
-   Check API data with Postman
-   Search for libraries to use charts
-   Create the project with Vite and React
-   Install axios for data fetching from the API
-   Write code to fetch endpoints and get data
-   Install Tremor and Tailwind to use the charts in Tremor library
-   Read Tremor documentation
-   Format the data from the endpoints to use in the charts
-   Use Tremor components to style the ui and implement the charts components

### Task 2:

-   Search for animation libraries
-   Enable animations in Tremor
-   Add custom css transitions to components

### Task 3:

-   Search libraries that had choropleth maps charts
-   Install React Simple Maps , d3-scale and React Tootip

-   Format the api response to implement the map chart
-   Write the code to use the data in the map chart
-   Style the component with Tremor and Tailwind

## What we've learned

-   We've gained a deeper understanding of how to work with and manipulate data in order to present it in a meaningful way. This involved learning how to parse raw data, transform it, and structure it in a way that would be suitable for a chart.

-   I've learnt to use charting libraries effectively to display data in a user-friendly and visually appealing manner. Understanding how to use different types of charts based on the nature of the data was an important part of this process.

## What follows

-   We plan to explore more sophisticated data visualization techniques and chart types. This will enable us to effectively present a broader range of data in future projects.
-   Completing this challenge was a significant achievement for us. It opened our eyes to the power and importance of data visualization for make an impact. And it was a lot of fun! As a team, we are excited to continue learning and improving our skills in this area. Our aim is to leverage these new skills in our future projects.
